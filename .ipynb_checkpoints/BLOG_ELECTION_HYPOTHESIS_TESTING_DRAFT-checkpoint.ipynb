    "A government election was done between two congressman in New Jersey, and a republican candidate lost. A sample of 1577 was taken out of a population of approximately 400,000 registered voters. What can we learn about the people who voted using the data?\n",

    "I got this data set from a take home job interview and felt pretty compelled to play around with it. I experimented with it and looked at a lot of different modelling techniques. Despite modelling techniques, the most interesting insights I discovered were by using hypothesis tests. The hypothesis tests were done by exploiting the central limit theorem using permutation resampling.\n",

    "The raw data was a table for which each row described an individual voter, and whether or not that voter voted for the repbulican candidate. The \"target\" was the column \"voted_for_republican\", and the other columns were descriptive features for each voter. By looking at the target column, we can see that the two cateogories are those who voted for him and those who voted against him. In the sample taken, 769 voters (49%) voted for the republican and 808 voted against."
